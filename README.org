This is an example of an Emacs set up using literate programming with [[http://www.orgmode.org][Org-mode]]. This is simply my personals set-up and thus reflects my needs as a linguist --- a lot of this is writing with LaTeX and Markdown, but some programming support as well. This is a version of my long-growing init file that I have cleaned up using [[http://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]], with inspiration from other people's generously shared ideas (most obviously [[https://github.com/noahfrederick/dots/blob/master/emacs.d/emacs.org][Noah Frederick's]]).

Two main things. The set-up depends on [[http://cask.readthedocs.org/en/latest/][Cask]] --- make sure to run =cask install= per the instructions before you attempt opening Emacs. Second, some things are defined in the =private.el= file, which I'm not sharing here. I provide an example file which you can fill with the values you need --- just make sure to rename the example file.

Finally, if a particular package is giving you trouble, you can always temporarily disable it. To do this, insert =:disabled t= after =(use-package package-name=.

Happy hacking!
